## Proven ROI and Cost Benefits

### Immediate Financial Returns

Businesses can achieve a return on investment (ROI) of 30-200% in the first year of implementing automation, primarily through labor savings.

**Concrete Cost Savings Examples:** Consider a document-intensive process that involves 10 employees who each earn $100,000 per year, or $1 million total. If an IDP solution can automate 75% of those tasks – a perfectly reachable goal – the cost per task falls to just 50 cents, so the company saves $750,000 per year.

### Industry Leadership Gap

Automation leaders were able to reduce the cost of processes by 22% in 2023, whereas lagging companies managed only 8%. The top quartile of leaders lowered costs by an average 37%.

### Comprehensive Cost Reduction

A comprehensive study by Gartner highlights that organizations adopting automation technologies can reduce process costs by 30% to 50%.

## Productivity and Efficiency Gains

### Dramatic Time Savings

IDP can potentially cut processing time by 50% or even more, eliminating errors and profoundly boosting productivity and efficiency.

**Real-World Time Savings:**

* Employees involved in high-volume, repetitive tasks like data entry, invoicing, or document gathering saw the most significant impact from robotic process automation (RPA) in Power Automate—saving 200 hours per year  
* A pharmaceutical organization reported saving 11,000 hours by running 72 RPA automations for document processing

### Error Reduction and Accuracy

Implementing IDP can significantly lower the chance of errors by more than half, reducing the risk by 52% or greater. IDP has the potential to attain an impressive accuracy rate of 99%.

### Productivity Multiplication

According to McKinsey, automation may boost global productivity growth by 0.8-1.4 % every year, while 73% of the leaders in the IT industry attribute 10-50% of time savings in performing tasks to automation.
