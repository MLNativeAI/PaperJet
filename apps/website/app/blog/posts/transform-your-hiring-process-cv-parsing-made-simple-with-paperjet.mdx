## **The Resume Screening Challenge Every HR Team Faces**

Picture this: You've posted a compelling job opening and within 24 hours, 200+ resumes flood your inbox. Each candidate has carefully crafted their CV in different formats: PDF, Word, HTML, even scanned images. Some follow standard layouts, others get creative with designs and unusual section headers.

Your hiring team now faces the dreaded task of manually reviewing each resume, extracting key information like contact details, skills, experience levels, and education history. **At an average of 7.4 seconds per resume in high-volume hiring environments**, you're looking at hours of tedious, error-prone work before you even identify your top candidates.
