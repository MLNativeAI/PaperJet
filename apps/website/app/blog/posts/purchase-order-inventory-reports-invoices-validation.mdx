## The Challenge: Managing Complex Operations Across 6 Locations

AirFlow Systems, a leading air conditioning and HVAC equipment distributor operating across 6 locations, had built a successful business serving contractors and installers. With 70 employees spread across 6 branch locations, the company handled over 2,000 transactions monthly, managing inventory for hundreds of SKUs from dozens of international suppliers.

But rapid growth was creating operational bottlenecks that threatened their competitive edge in Poland's booming construction market.

**The mounting challenges:**

* **450+ purchase orders monthly** across 6 locations with inconsistent processing  
* **Manual inventory reconciliation** taking 8+ hours per location weekly  
* **Invoice validation delays** causing payment disputes and supplier relationship strain  
* **Coordination failures** between branches leading to stockouts and overstock situations  
* **Peak season chaos** during spring/summer HVAC installation periods

The numbers revealed the scope of the problem:

* **3.2 hours average** to process complex purchase orders with technical specifications  
* **48 hours** for complete inventory reconciliation across all branches  
* **€125,000 in tied-up capital** due to invoice processing delays  
* **15% error rate** in manual data entry causing supplier disputes  
* **23% overtime increase** during peak seasons

Traditional ERP solutions were either too expensive or didn't address their specific document-heavy workflows. The company needed a solution that could handle their unique challenges while integrating with existing systems.

## The Solution: Intelligent Document Automation for Multi-Location Operations

After evaluating several options, Klimazbyt implemented our document automation platform to streamline their three most critical document workflows:

### Automated Purchase Order Processing

* **Smart PO generation** from inventory triggers and sales forecasts  
* **Supplier catalog integration** automatically matching part numbers and specifications  
* **Multi-language processing** handling documents in multiple languages  
* **Technical specification extraction** from complex HVAC equipment datasheets  
* **Approval workflow automation** routing orders based on value thresholds and branch requirements

### Intelligent Inventory Reporting

* **Real-time stock level tracking** across all 6 locations  
* **Automated reconciliation** between physical counts and system records  
* **Seasonal demand forecasting** based on historical patterns and weather data  
* **Inter-branch transfer optimization** preventing stockouts while minimizing excess inventory  
* **Supplier performance analytics** tracking delivery times and quality metrics

### Advanced Invoice Data Validation

* **Three-way matching** automatically comparing invoices, purchase orders, and delivery receipts  
* **Currency conversion verification** for international supplier transactions  
* **Tax compliance checking** ensuring proper VAT handling across different regions  
* **Duplicate detection** preventing double payments  
* **Exception handling** flagging discrepancies for manual review

## Implementation: Systematic Rollout Across All Locations

### Phase 1: Pilot at Main Location (Weeks 1-3)

AirFlow Systems started with their largest location, focusing on purchase order automation for their top 10 suppliers representing 60% of purchase volume.

Key results from the pilot:

* Purchase order processing time dropped from 3.2 hours to 45 minutes  
* 95% accuracy in technical specification matching  
* Immediate improvement in supplier relationship due to faster, error-free orders

### Phase 2: Inventory Management Integration (Weeks 4-8)

The platform was configured to handle inventory reporting across all branches, connecting to existing warehouse management systems and implementing automated stock level monitoring.

### Phase 3: Full Invoice Automation (Weeks 9-16)

Complete invoice validation workflow was implemented, integrating with the company's accounting system and establishing automated approval routing based on business rules.

### Phase 4: Multi-Location Expansion (Weeks 17-24)

The solution was rolled out to all 6 branches with location-specific configurations for local suppliers, regional regulations, and branch-level approval hierarchies.
